# MongoDB `updateOne` Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to MongoDB's `updateOne` method when used with the `$set` operator and the `upsert: true` option.  The code snippet attempts to update a document if it exists, or insert it if it doesn't. However, the behavior isn't intuitive in scenarios where no matching documents exist.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

## Bug
The issue lies in the assumption that `$set` will implicitly create fields if they don't exist during an update even without an explicit `upsert`. This is not the case. The `upsert: true` option only creates the document if the query is entirely unmatched. This can lead to unexpected behavior when attempting to add new documents with `$set` operations that define fields that are not present in any matching document.

## Solution
To achieve the desired behavior, we must use the `updateMany` method with `upsert: true` to explicitly handle insertion in case of a non-matching query.
