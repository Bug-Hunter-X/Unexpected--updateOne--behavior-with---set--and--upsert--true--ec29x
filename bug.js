```javascript
const query = { name: 'John Doe' };
const update = { $set: { age: 30 } };

db.collection('users').updateOne(query, update, { upsert: true });
```
This code snippet intends to update a user's age or insert a new user if one with the given name doesn't exist. However, the `upsert: true` option in `updateOne` will only insert a new document if the query does not match any existing document. It will not update an existing document if the query doesn't match, even if you might expect it to based on the `$set` operation.  The problem arises from the expectation that `$set` will create the field if it doesn't exist during an update operation even without an explicit upsert, which is not the default behavior.
